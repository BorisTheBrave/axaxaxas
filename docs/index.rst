Axaxaxas documentation
====================================

Axaxaxas - *making sense of nonsense*.

Axaxaxas is a Python 3.3 implementation of an `Earley parser <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_parser>`_.
Earley parsers are a robust parser that can recognize any context-free grammar, with good support for amiguous grammars.
They have linear performance for a wide class of grammars, and worst case O(n^3).
